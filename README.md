## What is this
This is a wrapper for the Chatzy API, with some extra functionality. This aims to objectify Chatzy features in a way idiomatic to Python. This includes interfacing with the regular Chatzy client, as well as interfacing with Chatzy's chat with decoratable commands and events inspired by the design of [discordpy](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).
